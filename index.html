<p class="style2">
  <span class="after">The term “Pandemic” is one that carries a powerful meaning, conjuring fearful images of death and disease. Throughout the past several decades, many of these pandemics have been in the forefront of American minds. SARS, MERS, and Ebola are only a few of these that have elicited varying degrees of worry in the minds of the U.S. people. Though, never before has something been this dramatically world-changing, at least since the Spanish Flu, as the COVID-19 virus that is currently still ravaging through the country. Statistics rise dramatically and fear rises as it appears that the country is effectively floundering in its attempts to contain the virus and try and keep the system of the U.S. as stable as possible. The government that is sworn to protect their people is almost seemingly incapable of doing so to a great extent. While many other countries such as Italy and South Korea are on route to be steadily declining in cases, the U.S. is constantly on the rise, with over 700 thousand cases and counting. It looks to be that the problem here is most definitely a systemic one, stemming from the very structure that governs and rules the United States. Where more prevalently is this shown than the very head of the structure? What exactly does the President of the United States of America Donald Trump do regarding this pandemic? Unfortunately, the reaction to this is steeped heavily in propaganda that has been the backbone of his campaign even before his election. This propaganda, as will be seen, is entirely selfish, rooted in attempting to retain public perception about his own strength as a leader and a president. In Trump’s obvious failures during the pandemic, it is apparent that he still attempts to avoid blame and push it elsewhere to maintain the façade. This is definitely a severely critical approach to the situation; however this level of criticism is necessary in times of crisis like this. Donald Trump’s heavy use of propaganda is used to divert his failures to properly handle the situation, in order to secure a public image that will help him politically, especially for the next election. </span>
  <span class="before">The term “Pandemic” carries a dead, empty meaning that is utterly tiring to hear now. Throughout the past year and eight months, “Pandemic” has been at the forefront of any major media outlet of your choice, all the while little was ever done to change. SARS, MERS, and Ebola somehow seem like a sad joke at this point, a distant past where situations like this were taken care of with as little political bullshit as possible. Rising higher than ever, unprecedented statistics continue to expand to the point that it is hard to make any sense out of them. I wish I didn’t agree with this more than I already did at the time. Political instability, economic collapse, and extended social isolation cascaded this further than I, no, anyone could have thought. Do I wish I was just at the beginning of it all again? Back when our spring break of 2020 was extended another week? All we had to do was flatten the curve and move on. Look at us now— 700,000 infected in the U.S.? Check again, that’s over 700,000 dead. (Ritchie) But here, just talking specifically about Trump and his Propaganda and how that contributed to everything that unfolded out of the pandemic greatly, I cared about the problem, but did I care about the writing? Completing this paper was completing an assignment, with an amount of passion for sure, but passion attached to a rubric I had to follow, and a page count I had to meet. At the end of the day, that passion was in combat with the assignment as I just wanted it (this) to be over. In the result of criticizing the simple fact that Trump was able to stand in front of billions and lie for his own benefit, do I feel proud or disappointed in this pursuit? Trump’s deception and general negligence wasn’t, and still isn’t today, a new concept. Though I wonder what I would have written knowing how the rest of his presidency played out now. “The Big Lie” wasn’t a thing back then and that’s about as propagandizing as it gets.</span>
</p>


<p class="style1">
<span class="after">The kind of propaganda involved here heavily implies a previous failure on the president’s part, so before unraveling the propaganda here, it is important to first show how exactly this issue heavily implicates Trump. A question to start with is how exactly this is qualified as a “failure”, rather than just an extraordinary and unfortunate happening. To answer this question, the steps that were taken before the pandemic truly began to become an issue must be analyzed. The month of February is the most evident for Trump's negligence to the pandemic. It starts with a premature celebration, quickly reassuring the public that there is no risk, and that the U.S. (and by extension, himself) was incredibly successful in combating the virus. An article from the BMJ states that “President Donald Trump described the US response to the covid-19 outbreak as ‘a tremendous success’ and asserted that the risk to Americans was ‘very low’.” (Tanne, 1). This statement was given on the 27th of February, much before the outbreak truly started to take hold. The most prominent concept from this statement is simply as it says, Trump believed that everything from this point was finished; the pandemic was no more as of that moment in his own mind. This becomes truly incriminating when several other authorities, namely the CDC, were saying otherwise. An article by the CDC released around the same timeframe of February 25th clearly states, as the very first sentence in the discussion section of the article, that “COVID-19 is a serious public health threat.” (Jernigan) Here as far back as this, it is also recommended that “…school dismissals and social distancing in other settings (e.g., postponement or cancellations of mass gatherings and telework and remote-meeting options in workplaces)” (Jernigan) to be put into effect soon. If such drastic measures are called for by professionals at the CDC, why exactly is it that Trump is so eager to call this a success and that there is no further need for worry? The answer to this question falls back onto propaganda, an issue that now deeply sinks its roots into the pandemic panic at hand. </span>
<span class="before">But, just how big of a lie does something have to be before it no longer needs to be reasoned with any further? Is feeling the pressure to prove a concept such as this toying with the idea that there is a chance this was all, somehow, okay? Proving Trump is a propagandist is proving the obvious. But it was the proper thing to do—the most “academically sound” way to go about this process. Pouring over every ridiculous claim Trump has made between then-and-now in this way feels as if I would be repeating old, stale news that everyone is tired of hearing. Perhaps it would be best to, for now, follow Cixous and become the “Anti-logos weapon” in the face of this problem, to “tear [us] away by means of this research, this job of analysis and illumination.” (Cixous 880) This is not to completely reject sane, obvious facts like the ones that were sitting in front of Trump’s face the entire time. This is to write what we intuitively know what surrounds us—it is what we feel because that is what we know. Those who follow Trump’s rhetoric also tend to follow the rhetoric of <a href = "https://twitter.com/benshapiro/status/695638866993115136?lang=en" target="_blank">‘facts don’t care about your feelings’</a> (Shapiro), but wasn’t that callous, robotic way of thought what got us into this position in the first place? How much of “Making America Great Again” was looking at immigrants in that same, narrow-minded view as criminals or threats—illegal aliens or terrorists—rather than living, breathing, and feeling people? How much of this pandemic was looking at the disease as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dl78PQGJpiI" target="_blank">“The China Virus”</a> (CNBC) and pointing out the seemingly low mortality rate, instead of seeking immediate action to protect those few vulnerable 700,000 (and counting) people? Looking back, it is unusual how the rhetoric of facts-and-logic inhabits the minds of many that would still choose to deny the obvious truths that surround them. You don’t even have to know the numbers, taking the blindfold of propaganda off and seeing the world in its shaken, altered state is enough to know that everything is wrong. Yet, people didn’t, and likely still haven’t.</span>
</p>


<p class="style1">
<span class="after">Propaganda, admittedly, is rather tricky to pin down in an in-the-moment scenario. Often, such chaos tends to make deciphering what is and is not true a gargantuan task. This is what makes it effective. However, there are certain elements to propaganda that are almost universal, making this type of rhetoric able to be defined under the term. Most prominently, “the propagandist builds his techniques on the basis of his knowledge of man, his tendencies, his needs, his psychic mechanisms…” (Ellul, 1) Effectively, Ellul states that propaganda conforms itself to its audience. The information that is being transferred from the authority to the public is not there to inform, rather it is there to provide the desired outlook to the audience itself. This is seen most evidently in Trump’s reassurance to the American people as seen previous. Looking back at what Donald Trump says regarding the situation, he does not only reassure by stating how unlikely he perceives the threat to be, but he as well calls the situation “a tremendous success.” This is where propaganda is most evident. Stating that the risk was “very low” at that particular point in time was not entirely false. As an average American in that particular moment, but that particular segment of time alone, the truth is that you were not likely to get infected.  However, what was being hidden by this statement is the fact that in the future, the risk will likely increase as stated by the CDC. Trump’s primary target audience here is those who are worried about the virus, which at the time was a large majority of the American population. Trump attempts to remove the stress of the virus, and attributes this “tremendous success” with the COVID-19 pandemic to the U.S. government, and by extension his administration, and even further yet: himself. This is the core of much of Trump’s propaganda. As Trump negates the worries of the coronavirus from the American people, and claims his governmental administration the victor, he is able to gain further trust and respect in the political realm.  It is evident that Trump is hard-pressed to give the public the bad news here; rather, he reacts in a way the propagandist would: a way that would give people the best image of him at that time above everything else. Trump here looks to be the savior, the person who took charge during this horrifying time and vanquished the coronavirus. This is not just a select case, and rather is something that encompasses his entire reaction to this pandemic. It will be seen that little of what Trump says is primarily focused on informing the public about the true dangers here and leading the country to safety, but instead is much more centralized in his political prestige and success, especially with the next election just over the horizon.</span>
<span class="before">Now we’re no longer in-the-moment but, for the most part, in the aftermath of Donald Trump’s presidency. As of today, you don’t hear that much about him anymore, so where does this lead us? I wouldn’t go as far to say that the chaos is completely out-of-mind just yet, but as Trump’s presidency ended, the apparent effect of this pandemic propaganda echoes deeply day-by-day. January 6th made this even more obvious. About two-hundred and fifty-three days after this paper was initially written, this somehow expected but utterly jarring event took place. Ellul mentions that propaganda conforms to its audience—in that, it fits to what they desire but never seeks to fulfill any promised goals. But, likewise, it “tends to establish a set of rules, rigorous, precise and tested, that are not merely recipes but impose themselves on every propagandist, who is less and less free to follow his own impulses.” (Ellul, 1) Doubtful how precise and tested these rules are, but there is no arguing with how rigorously they are followed by the ex-president’s supporters. Rules that are so rigorously followed, that once the original rhetor himself tries to go against what has already been set— he, too, is the target of disdain. The few lines: “But I recommend take the vaccines. I did it. It's good. Take the vaccines” (nbcnews) was met with boos and jeers from a crowd at an Alabama rally. Trump went against Trump, so it’s not about the man at all, it’s purely about the conditioning and propaganda that has all led his supporters astray. The way Ellul frames propaganda, too, is interesting, mentioning that “it is a matter of reaching and encircling the whole man and all men.” (Ellul, 8) Surely this is a product of the 1960s, dated and fixated on masculinity as it may be. But this focus brings back ideas from Cixous—consider propaganda’s relation to logos. Truth is taken, and then forcibly twisted and until it finally meets the goal of the rhetor. It is an appeal to logos without understanding or feeling the world around the body. In this way, Trumps propaganda ignores words from those like Cixous, words that feel as much as they know, “words [that] fall almost always upon the deaf male ear, which hears in language only that which speaks in the masculine.” (Cixous, 881) The masculine, in this case, being this foolish, surface-level interaction with logos. I am not about to say Trump was responsible for the whole Pandemic, that would, too, be foolish. Looking back, though, I wonder how successful vaccines would have been without his original reactions to the virus. Without him telling the greater population that the virus was a hoax or a fraud from the beginning, to telling us not to worry about it and that it’s under control, to later <a href = "https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/why-you-should-not-use-ivermectin-treat-or-prevent-covid-19" target="_blank">letting his followers swallow horse medicine</a> (FDA) as an alternative to the facts-and-logic of the medical industry that’s kept us alive for generations.</span>
</p>

<p class="style1">
<span class="after">In similar combat with information, Trump’s blatant attacks on “fake news” sources are possibly the most egregious part of his reaction to this pandemic that can be classified as propaganda. This is not something that is new to Trump’s presidency, and really it was the headline idea that followed Trump ever since the elections in 2016. However, when this is coupled with a crisis situation such as this, it becomes much more worrisome. In a public broadcast given on April 13th, CBS News Whitehouse correspondent Paula Reid questioned Trump about the lack of action in February, and Trump very suddenly retaliated, stating “You know you’re a fake, you know that. Your whole network, the way you cover it is fake…. but the people are wise to you, that’s why you have a lower approval rating than you’ve ever had before times probably three.” (CBS) Here, Trump lashes out and claims that the rhetor, Paula Reid, as well as the media outlet she stands for, CBS News, is “fake news”. This attack of calling them “fake” is also in extension calling that specific news outlet corrupt. Trump has always targeted this “corruption” throughout his political career, but it is important to note that these “anticorruption campaigns are frequently at the heart of fascist political movements.” (Stanley, 25) Arguably, this is incredibly close to the core of Trump’s response to COVID-19. This is evident in the fact that this is not the only claim of ‘corruption’ that Trump gives during this outburst alone. Shortly after, Trump gives further examples, asking “Why didn’t Biden apologize…” referring to Biden’s remarks on Trump’s travel restrictions, as well as asking “Why did the democrats think I acted too quickly?” (CBS) The line of reasoning here is subverting the blame. While Trump is being asked the simple question of “What did you do with the time you bought in February?” the obvious lack of action as presented earlier is deflected in such an attack. Trump in this instance targets his audience, that is those who already are on his side in the first place, and effectively “removes” those news sources from the pool of legitimate sources for those individuals. This blockades much of the criticism this audience will truly interact with, and they will be much more inclined to consume only Trump-positive media. They will not truly interact with such criticisms, as they would no longer even be considered. What these media sources say is, in their eyes, coming from a fake, unreliable, and corrupt source and any opinions that come from these sources are immediately disregarded by simply originating from those sources. This is another piece of the propaganda in this instance, and seeks to garner some control over what media is and is not viewed—a hugely defining concept of fascism.  The reason this level of propaganda typically only affects people who are already in favor of Trump ideologically, as those who are initially critical of Trump would be inclined to do and think the opposite of what is said. This is because those critical of Trump are immediately put on the defensive by Trump’s propaganda, and in effect, they are in some ways alienated and labeled as “corrupt” as well. It is a brash manipulation of information that is at the forefront of what Trump says, none of it is really “subliminal”, and this is a defining factor of propaganda.</span>
<span class="before">Combatting the truth like this was always a key part of Trump’s presidency. The ways that Trump channeled a loyal following down a series of media channels that propagate his, and only his narrative is only made more apparent today. Division was key as people either watched only these sources or avoided only these sources, allowing the spread of misinformation in primarily conservative audiences to continue even past the scope of Trump’s presidency and sending shockwaves into the present. The biggest struggle seems to be not the virus itself but the fact that, as the WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros stated in a security conference on February 15th 2020, “we’re not just fighting an epidemic; we’re fighting an infodemic.” (Tedros) It is noted in this conference that fake news spreads faster than the virus, and it is interesting to compare this to Trump’s rhetoric of fake news. His outburst at Paula Reid demonstrates how he lashes out on the offensive—the first to call information that is outside of his own propaganda 'fake news'. Saying that “anticorruption campaigns are frequently at the heart of fascist political movements” (Stanley, 25) still holds true, as until the very end Trump found ways to hide his own misinformation underneath another, fabricated corruption. To him, if he was not the winner, everyone else was cheating. It is hard to say if this is because he simply could not fathom himself losing, or if it was a nefarious act to claw back any ounce of power by any means necessary. Perhaps it was some of both. The 2020 election is truly the most egregious example of this mentality, to the point that, as Trump finally faced defeat, he was scrambling to find any way to victory. On the surface, the fake news was as apparent as ever—I hardly need to cite the seemingly omnipresent examples of fake news, do I? It is likely that you remember, and I remember the chaos that cumulated in the aftermath of Trump losing the election. But underneath this brazen campaign of misinformation, the former president’s call with Brad Raffensperger especially highlights his desperation. He found himself looking for any possible way that he could claim fraud, asking Ryan Germany this series of questions: <a href="https://youtu.be/FBIG5Tv0fZk?start=1850&end=1875" target="_blank">“But have they moved the inner parts of the machines, and replaced them with other parts? Are you sure, Ryan? What about, what about the uh, what about the ballots, the shredding of the ballots? Have they been shredding ballots?”</a> (11Alive, 30:50 – 31:15) As Trump’s power began the crumble, his efforts became more desperate, reckless, and egregious. If any other president did this in a vacuum, they would immediately be classified as insane. Yet, his propaganda was so deeply ingrained to a point that this zeal was matched in the crowd of followers underneath him. But, as stated before, it is only the idea of Trump that has been implanted—not the man himself. What would have been the case if Trump went against Trump and conceded the election? Would he too be a traitor to his followers in the same way he was while promoting the COVID vaccine in that Alabama rally? Thus defines the infodemic. A virus of misinformation that has been long removed from its source, plaguing the highly connected digital world that we live in. The data stream within our cables are analogous for the bloodstream within our veins. Small, infectious lies propagate into a great pandemic of misinformation, twisting and distorting the truth while patient zero loses any control of the plague he started.</span>
</p>

<p class="style1">
<span class="after">This attack on so-called “corrupt” media is intense, however, this is more disastrous when combined with Trump’s tendency to rewrite his own narrative based on the current state of the pandemic. With the same line of reasoning that propaganda conforms to the audience itself, Trump has made several changes to his rhetoric and logic over the course of the pandemic that reflects this. On March 17th, barely over two weeks after his statement on February 27th, another televised and live-broadcasted press briefing had a very distinct change in urgency. Trump states that he “always known this is a real—this is a pandemic. I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic.” (CNBC). This is particularly when the worries of Americans were much greater, and the numbers were much more difficult to sweep under the rug. There is no longer the possibility of acting like his administration has vanquished this pandemic as it spreads quickly throughout the nation. Now, Trump is acting as if he always has known, as if he never had stated that the risk was “very low” (Tanne, 1) to Americans as a whole. It is now known that this is false, and that Trump neglects accountability on a faulty statement that was made only 19 days previous in February. Propaganda as a medium rarely stays the same as society changes; rather propaganda must also “express the fundamental currents of the society it seeks to influence” often burying itself within “sociological presumptions, spontaneous myths, and broad ideologies.” (Ellul, 21) This is precisely what Trump does with his reactions to the COVID-19. It is polymorphic in nature, having the façade of holding one idea and suddenly changing it without admitting to holding the faulty mindset previously. This is incredibly problematic as it allows the propagandist to put effectively whatever line of reasoning fits best in front of his true motive. Trump’s use of this propaganda as seen here, still is reflecting on him positively, as if he always knew and that he was the one that was being restrained by the rest of the system. Trump wants to subvert accountability in order to put himself in a better light for his political career, and this pandemic gives him the leverage to manipulate the perceptions of the people to do so. This is such a problematic event that it is almost terrifying that this is taking place and it simply feels normal to the average American. Before, such a scandal of this magnitude would have many people in uproar; it would flood the news and other mainstream media for weeks on end. Yet, that does not happen here; the most that may happen is perhaps a day or two in the limelight on social media before disappearing into the chaos. The sheer magnitude of this lack of accountability on Trump’s part may be the most troubling thing that will be reflected back on in the future.</span>
<span class="before">The source of this information plague is, of course, not just lies—but shifting the narrative as many times as it takes to always be in the right. The number of times our former double-impeached President has ‘changed his mind’ is truly massive. It becomes difficult to understand what Trump truly wants—but it appears the only constant truth within Trump’s rhetoric is victory, by any means necessary. You don’t need more words from me; it has already been said. <br><br>

<p class="style1">
<span class="after">This propaganda is deeply ingrained in the situation as it stands, and at this point in time, it does not seem to be stopping any time soon. Though, the damage that is done is unfortunately already visible. It does not take much to uncover this damage; a simple Google search of “coronavirus” will bring live details on the amount of infections in the U.S. As of April 23rd, the CDC states that total cases in the U.S. stand at 865,585. (CDC). This is multitudes over any other country in the world. Arguably, it would be incredibly unfair to pin the entirety of this disaster on the doings of one man. However, it is still Trump’s actions that further caused damage, and his negligence to truly work with institutions like the CDC earlier on are massive blunders that most definitely added to the pandemonium. The rhetoric that Trump portrays to the media, and therefore the public, affect how exactly they are going to react. Trump resides in a space of power, and obviously as a leader, the followers follow. The initial precedent set, with no one feeling as if they were at risk, made the country extraordinarily vulnerable to spreading COVID-19. This is seen in the actions of the public weeks after, on March 19th, even after Trump switched his logic, the New York Post reports that “college kids are bucking advice to practice social distancing amid the coronavirus pandemic and are partying in tight quarters aboard booze cruises.” (DeNinno) Such tight spaces on a ship that keeps everyone contained within it for extended periods of time are bound to be rife with COIVD-19, even if only one participant is infected. Would occurrences like these still happen if Trump was much earlier to declare a state of urgency to the people? At the very least, this would have at least reduced the amount of gatherings such as these. However, Trump never wanted to instill that fear early on, for his own fear that it would hurt his political approval rating. Trump did not want to be the person in charge when everything went to chaos. Rather, he wanted to be in charge when that chaos was corrected, where he was the victor of the situation. This, in the end, can cause a dramatic lack of trust for Trump. Trust is something that is incredibly important, as Dr. Allan R. Escher Jr. states three important roles of a government during this time: “The coordination of services… accurate and timely communication, and maintaining the public trust in their government.” (Escher, 2). Here, two of the three of these have been shown to be faulty in Trump’s response to the COVID-19 Pandemic. The communication was neither timely nor definitely not accurate, especially in correspondence to the CDC, in fact, it has been shown to be the absolute opposite of such. It is strange that in Trump’s haste to garner this kind of public trust in the end appears to be actually reducing the trust of the public. Yet, it also can be seen that Trump appears to value his approval rating over the true safety of the American people in his eyes. Whether it is due to the fact that he does not fully understand the power of the position he is in, or something much more callous is difficult to decipher. However, what is known is how prominent Trump’s use of propaganda is during this pandemic, and it most likely will be present far into the future, perhaps even past the scope of this crisis.</span>
<span class="before">It could be said that Trump’s direct propaganda has come to an end nearly two years later, but looking at the world around us, has it really? On the physical, pandemic side, it is apparent that the virus is still going stronger than anyone would have hoped. When I wrote the original paper in April of 2020, two different numbers were used—a difference of around a hundred thousand cases between the very first paragraph, and this one. Academically, this is a mistake. Inconsistent numbers that should have been corrected to reflect one time in the present. But said inconsistency speaks more to that point in time. Within the few weeks that spanned between writing that first number and the second, a hundred thousand cases proliferated. Expanding this gap, the total number of cases throughout the past two years in the States alone is at, currently, 48 million, with 140 thousand confirmed current cases. (Ritchie) Numbers like this prove that the physical consequences of this infodemic are still present. But the rhetor is no longer in his position of power—his voice has been, as much as it can be, muted. Trump can be banned from Twitter and ignored by the media, but these messages still linger. Messages like these do not even have to be said, but can involve actions that were, or were not, taken that are presented to one of the largest audiences in the world. After a White House meeting to unveil Trump’s nominee for the supreme court, “at least 11 people who attended the event on 26 September tested positive,” a direct manifestation of his own “skepticism about measures such as masks and lockdowns to combat the spread of COVID-19” (BBC) Trust is something I mentioned a lot here—where, through Trump’s intentional misinformation on the pandemic, trust would be lost. But here I had neglected to fully realize that people did not just trust the rhetor himself, but more so the ideas that he represents. The rally that took place in Alabama comes to mind once again. Trump quickly reconciled the crowd after the booing, saying to them that “You’ve got your freedoms.” (abcnews) Freedom is one of, if not, the most crucial idea to Trump’s rhetoric that remains today. But this is propaganda, it is not just about freedom, but removing those who are supposedly there to take that freedom away. To do away with the ideas that they care for, simply because “they” are the ones doing it. “They” want you to wear masks—not to stay safe, but to take away your freedom. “They” want you to get vaccinated, not because it will help eliminate the virus, but to take away your freedom. This is where the trust of Trump’s following lays—not in the rhetor, but in the infodemic that he has spawned. I bring up this single, thirty second video multiple times to demonstrate that it is apparent that Trump had lost control of his own misinformation. In those few seconds, his own words visibly collapsed upon him. The information plague that his propaganda had inevitably created continues without the rhetor. We know the virus is still as much of a problem as it has always been, but think for a moment, how much do people seem to care at this point? Is this a symptom of exhaustion, or is this infodemic about as prolific as the virus?</span>
</p>


<p class="style3">
<span class="after">With all considered, the situation at hand seems rather grave, and the response that the U.S. government has given is overall, subpar. It’s a troubling time when a president uses a situation as dire as this one in order to promote political gain. This may be a common occurrence to attempt to elevate one’s appearance politically, especially this close to the next election; however it is the situation this is ingrained in that is problematic. This is an entirely unprecedented situation, and a strong, quick, and stable reaction is necessary to pull through this with the least amount of damage possible. However, the use of propaganda aimed at easing the worry of the American people, as if the government already had everything under control in the first place, the peoples’ guards were lowered and allowed panic to set in when the virus inevitably spread through the nation. Many nations did have this same rhetoric, that at the beginning things were fine, but those nations often still listened to organizations of professionals monitoring the situation. The United States, too, had the examples of China and Italy to learn from before this. Trump instead neglected such advice to make himself appear more in control of the situation personally, in order to prove him to be fit as president, and possibly situate himself as president for the next term. It is an unfortunate situation that this is the case; however this appears to be a major contributing factor as to the chaos, widespread misinformation, and ignorance towards pandemic-control practices in the nation. This appears to have led to the U.S. having the most cases out of any country in the world multiple times over.  Fortunately, as this situation is seemingly new to the modern world, there is a little knowledge to be gained here. It reveals many cracks and flaws in the system that governs the country, but hopefully will lead to strides that patches these flaws. It is a learning experience that, with some hope, will bring a much more calm, calculated and stable reaction to the next crisis that affects this country.</span>
<span class="before">Optimism is hard to come by, but it is truly necessary. Still living through an ongoing pandemic and infodemic, I continue think that there is a lot to be learned from all of this, and hopefully improvements for generations down the line. On one hand it is understandable to feel as if the world around us has been shattered beyond repair—as of writing this the omicron variant of Covid appears to be causing another stir in the media, adding to this hopelessness. At first, I might have joked we would run out of letters in the Greek alphabet soon, but this may end up being the case. Yet, we made it through to the vaccines, the largest and darkest parts appear to be behind us, and some semblance of normalcy is hopefully approaching. On my end, I was able to attend a few classes in person towards the end of my degree, albeit still wearing masks and still carrying that tired, omnipresent worry of the pandemic. Vaccines are of course here, and many people seem to be taking them, but many are hesitant. A general sense of distrust to be one of the biggest symptoms of the infodemic—a lack of trust in the government, healthcare systems, and anything in the media. But exhaustion appears the be the most prevalent, one that can go without saying or deliberating the causes of. You feel it, I feel it, everyone has some sense of it over the past two years. This paragraph could go further, it could bring to light another few sentences that add some knowledge. Yet it doesn’t need to. Living through it all is explanation enough. Instead of talking further to this assignment, I’ll do what we all have needed for quite some time now: give us a break from the headache and end this discussion here.</span>
